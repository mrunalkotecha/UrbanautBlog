Singapore is an exciting city, known to be a haven for shopping, street food, and nightlife. Of course, it might be a little different to explore when there are little ones in tow. Suffer the wrath of your offspring, or plan your outings so as to engage and appease them? A reliable Singapore source, Byravee is a content marketer and cool mom– and she knows how to do it all.
We’ve collected a few of her special recommendations for things to do in Singapore––that will indulge both you and your kids!
Try a meal at Baker and Cook – a spot tucked away in Dempsey, where you can grab a cup of coffee and relax. Gorge on some of their delectable avocado smash with freshly baked bread, and let your kids run free at a beautiful playground in the back.
If you’re in the mood to stroll around indoors in between meals, Byravee recommends the ArtScience museum located at Bayfront Avenue. The museum is specifically designed to engage with children in an interactive format that gets them asking questions about the world around them. Let them participate in experiments conducted by Team Labs, or rent bicycles and explore the nearby Gardens by the Bay.
